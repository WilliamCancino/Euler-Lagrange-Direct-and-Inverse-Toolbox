# Euler-Lagrange-Direct-and-Inverse-Toolbox

This repository contains a MATLAB framework designed for the simulation and analysis of dynamic systems using the Euler-Lagrange formulation. The project allows solving both the **direct problem** (simulating the behavior of the system from its known parameters) and the **inverse problem** (estimating unknown parameters of the system from noisy measurements of its behavior).

## ðŸ“œ General description

The core of this project is the ability to define a dynamical system symbolically through its Lagrangian and its Rayleigh dissipation function. From this definition, the framework automatically derives the equations of motion, solves them numerically and provides tools to visualize the results.
